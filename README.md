# 🎬 Movie App

A responsive **Movie Search & Browsing Web Application** built using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**, powered by the **OMDb API**.

The app displays **recent movies on initial load (year-based)** and allows users to **search movies by title**, browse results with **pagination**, and interact with a clean, modern UI.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Working with third-party APIs and handling responses safely  
- Managing UI state (search, pagination, page count)  
- Debugging real-world frontend issues (CSS class mismatches, API errors)  
- Building interactive UI without relying on frameworks  

---

## 📌 Note

OMDb does not provide a dedicated “latest movies” endpoint, so recent movies are displayed using a **year-based filtering approach**, which is suitable for learning and portfolio projects.
